   PROPOSED PROJECTS 
    
 1- Electronic medical record software 
  
 With the advancement in technology there is a huge shift from paper medical record to electronic medical record. 
 Electronic medical record software offers a platform that make it easy for healthcare professional to access patient's record.  
 In this project I will develop and test a software that will enable medical facilities to manage health record efficiently.  
 the end state of this project is to have a software capable of executing the following tasks: 
 -store personal information 
 -input and store data during medical screening/visit 
 -Practice management and billing  
 -process pharmacy orders 
 -save and retrieve medical data 
 -offer a communication platform between the patient and the physician. 

 Examples:

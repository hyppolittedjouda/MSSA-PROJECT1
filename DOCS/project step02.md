selected project: Data base application for pharmaceutical company. 

In this project, I will create a data base application that will be used by phamaceutical companies to effectively manage patients prescriptions .
with the advancement in technology, there is a huge need for softwares in the medical and phamaceutical field. This sofware will have two logins 
option,user can login as an administrator to imput data or as a patient to retrieve data and make request. Administrator will be able to create a
database with variables such as:user ID, names, age, email, date of birth, address, contact information, prescriptions, medication refill alert.
The administrator will be responsible for the management and maintenance of the database. 

The patient will be able to login in the application and perform action such as: modify or cancel refill, check past and future refill, request
information about a medication. This application will provide tremendous benefits to the users:
First, the application will provide tools that will enable patient to access their prescriptions information in one click and eliminate the long
wait time experienced on the phone; Current system used by most phamarcy requires customers to call in for any request or information. 
second, the patient can request a refill and receive notification when the prescription is ready. that eliminate the wait time patients experience
 at the pharmacy.

This new application will be convenient to both the pharmaceutical company and the customer. by using this new system and encouraging customer to
sign up, the company will significantly reduce the number of customer service phone calls received.
